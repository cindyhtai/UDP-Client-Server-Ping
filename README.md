# UDP-Client-Server-Ping
This is a client and server program where the client determines the round-trip time (RTT) to the server. To determine the RTT delay, the client records the time on sending a ping request to the server, and then records the time on receiving a ping response from the server. The difference in the two times is the RTT.
